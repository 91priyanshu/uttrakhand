<h1 style="font-size: 28px;">Haridwar</h1> 
<p style="font-size: 20px;"> Haridwar is a city and municipal corporation in the Haridwar district
     of Uttarakhand, India. With a population of 228,832 in 2011, it is the second-largest city in the state and the largest in the 
     district
     The city is situated on the right bank of the Ganges river, at the foothills of the Shivalik ranges.[5] Haridwar is regarded as a 
     holy place for Hindus, hosting important religious events and serving as a gateway to several prominent places of worship. Most
      significant of the events is the Kumbha Mela, which is celebrated every 12 years in Haridwar. During the Haridwar Kumbh Mela, 
    millions of pilgrims, devotees, and tourists congregate in Haridwar to perform ritualistic bathing on the banks of the Ganges to 
    wash away their sins to attain moksha.</p>

   <p style="font-size: 20px;">  According to Puranic legend, Haridwar, along with Ujjain, Nashik, and Prayag, is one of four sites where drops of amrita,[6] the
    elixir of immortality, accidentally spilled over from a kumbha (pitcher) while being carried by the celestial bird Garuda during
    the Samudra Manthana, or the churning of the ocean of milk.[7] Brahma Kund, the spot where the amrita fell, is believed to be 
    located at Har ki Pauri (literally, "footsteps of the Lord") and is considered to be the most sacred ghat of Haridwar.[8]
     It is also the primary centre of the Kanwar pilgrimage, in which millions of participants gather sacred water from the Ganges 
    and carry it across hundreds of miles to dispense as offerings in Shiva shrines.[9] Today, the city is developing beyond its
      religious importance with the fast-developing industrial estate of the State Industrial Development Corporation of Uttarakhand
     (SIDCUL), and the close by township of Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), as well as its affiliated ancillaries.</p>
     
   <p style="font-size: 20px;"> Haridwar presents a kaleidoscope of Indian culture and development. In sacred writings, it has been differently specified as 
     Kapilsthan, Gangadwar and Mayapuri. It is additionally a passage for the Chota Char Dham (the four principal pilgrim destinations
      in Uttarakhand).</p>
     
    <h1 style="font-size: 28px;">Etymology</h1>
     
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Meandering main Ganga river, known here as Neel Dhara (left) and the Ganga canal (right), passing through Haridwar.
     The modern name of the town has two spellings: Haridwar and Hardwar. Each of these names has its own connotation.</p>
     
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">In Sanskrit, the liturgical language of Hinduism, Hari means "Vishnu", while dvāra means "gateway". So, Haridwar translates to 
     "The Gateway to Vishnu". It earns this name because it is typically the place where pilgrim's start their journey to visit a </p>
     prominent temple of Vishnu – Badrinath.
     
   <p style="font-size: 20px;"> Similarly, Hara could also mean "Shiva".[7] Hence, Hardwar could stand for "Gateway to Shiva". Hardwar is also a typical place to 
     start a pilgrim's journey in order to reach Mount Kailash, Kedarnath, the northernmost Jyotirlinga and one of the sites of the 
     smaller Char Dham pilgrimage circuit – all important places for worship for Hindus.</p>
     
   <p style="font-size: 20px;">  According to legend, it was in Haridwar that goddess Ganga descended when Shiva released the mighty river from the locks of his 
     hair. The River Ganga, after flowing for 253 kilometres (157 mi) from its source at Gaumukh at the edge of the Gangotri Glacier, 
     enters the Gangetic Plain for the first time at Haridwar, which gave the city its ancient name, Gangadwára.</p>
