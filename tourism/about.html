<h1>Tourism generates income and creates easily accessible training opportunities and jobs, as well as sales markets for services
     and local products. Infrastructure. Revenue from tourism can be used to expand important transport, energy and other 
     infrastructure, and for waste and wastewater management.
    
     Tourism is travel for pleasure, and the commercial activity of providing and supporting such travel.[1] The World Tourism 
     Organization defines tourism more generally, in terms which go "beyond the common perception of tourism as being limited to 
     holiday activity only", as people "travelling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one 
     consecutive year for leisure and not less than 24 hours, business and other purposes".[2] Tourism can be domestic 
     (within the traveller's own country) or international, and international tourism has both incoming and outgoing implications
      on a country's balance of payments.

     Tourism numbers declined as a result of a strong economic slowdown (the late-2000s recession) between the second half of 2008 
     and the end of 2009, and in consequence of the outbreak of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus,[3][4] but slowly recovered until the
      COVID-19 pandemic put an abrupt end to the growth. The United Nations World Tourism Organization estimated that global 
      international tourist arrivals might decrease by 58% to 78% in 2020, leading to a potential loss of US$0.9–1.2 trillion in 
      international tourism receipts.
     
     Globally, international tourism receipts (the travel item in the balance of payments) grew to US$1.03 trillion (€740 billion)
      in 2005, corresponding to an increase in real terms of 3.8% from 2010.[6] International tourist arrivals surpassed the milestone
       of 1 billion tourists globally for the first time in 2012.[7] Emerging source markets such as China, Russia, and Brazil had 
       significantly increased their spending over the previous decade.
     
     Global tourism accounts for c. 8% of global greenhouse-gas emissions.[9] Emissions as well as other significant environmental 
     and social impacts are not always beneficial to local communities and their economies. For this reason, many tourist development
      organizations have begun to focus on sustainable tourism to mitigate the negative effects caused by the growing impact of tourism. The United Nations World Tourism Organization emphasized these practices by promoting tourism as part of the Sustainable Development Goals, through programs like the International Year for Sustainable Tourism for Development in 2017,[10] and programs like Tourism for SDGs focusing on how SDG 8, SDG 12 and SDG 14 implicate tourism in creating a sustainable economy.[11]
     
     Tourism has reached new dimensions with the emerging industry of space tourism, as well as the cruise ship industry. Another
      potential new tourism industry is virtual tourism.
     
     Etymology
     The English-language word tourist was used in 1772[12] and tourism in 1811. These words derive from the word tour, which comes
      from Old English turian, from Old French torner, from Latin tornare - "to turn on a lathe", which is itself from Ancient Greek
       tornos (τόρνος) - "lathe".
     
     Definitions
     In 1936, the League of Nations defined a foreign tourist as "someone traveling abroad for at least twenty-four hours".
      Its successor, the United Nations, amended this definition in 1945, by including a maximum stay of six months.
     
     In 1941, Hunziker and Kraft defined tourism as "the sum of the phenomena and relationships arising from the travel and stay of
      non-residents, insofar as they do not lead to permanent residence and are not connected with any earning activity."
      In 1976, the Tourism Society of England's definition was: "Tourism is the temporary, short-term movement of people to 
      destinations outside the places where they normally live and work and their activities during the stay at each destination. 
      It includes movements for all purposes."[19] In 1981, the International Association of Scientific Experts in Tourism defined 
      tourism in terms of particular activities chosen and undertaken outside the home.
     
     In 1994, the United Nations identified three forms of tourism in its Recommendations on Tourism Statistics:
     
     Domestic tourism, involving residents of the given country traveling only within this country
     Inbound tourism,[22] involving non-residents traveling in the given country
     Outbound tourism, involving residents traveling in another country
     Other groupings derived from the above grouping:[23]
     
     National tourism, a combination of domestic and outbound tourism
     Regional tourism, a combination of domestic and inbound tourism
     International tourism, a combination of inbound and outbound tourism
     The terms tourism and travel are sometimes used interchangeably. In this context, travel has a similar definition to tourism but
      implies a more purposeful journey. The terms tourism and tourist are sometimes used pejoratively, to imply a shallow interest in
       the cultures or locations visited. By contrast, traveller is often used as a sign of distinction. The sociology of tourism has
        studied the cultural values underpinning these distinctions and their implications for class relations.[24]
     
     There are many varieties of tourism. Of those types, there are multiple forms of outdoor-oriented tourism. Outdoor tourism is
      generally categorized into nature, eco, and adventure tourism (NEAT). These categories share many similarities but also have 
       unique characteristics. Nature tourism generally encompasses tourism activities that would take place outside. Nature tourism 
       appeals to a large audience of tourists and many may not know they are participating in this form of tourism. This type of 
       tourism has a low barrier to entry and is accessible to a large population. Ecotourism focuses on education, maintaining a 
       social responsibility for the community and the environment, as well as centering economic growth around the local economy.
        Weaver describes ecotourism as sustainable nature-based tourism.[25] Ecotourism is more specific than nature tourism and 
        works toward accomplishing a specific goal through the outdoors. Finally, we have adventure tourism. Adventure tourism is 
        the most extreme of the categories and includes participation in activities and sports that require a level of skill or
         experience, risk, and physical exertion.[25] Adventure tourism often appeals less to the general public than nature and 
         ecotourism and tends to draw in individuals who partake in such activities with limited marketing.
     
     It is important to understand that these definitions may vary. Perceived risk in adventure tourism is subjective and may change
      for each individual.
     
     Examples of these tourism types.
     
     Nature tourism
     
     Hiking, walking, camping
     Ecotourism
     
     Guided tours focusing on educating, summer camps, outdoor classes
     Adventure tourism
     
     White water rafting, ice climbing, mountaineering
     Tourism products
     According to the World Tourism Organization, a tourism product is:[26]
     
     "a combination of tangible and intangible elements, such as natural, cultural, and man-made resources, attractions, facilities, 
     services and activities around a specific center of interest which represents the core of the destination marketing mix and creates
      an overall visitor experience including emotional aspects for the potential customers. A tourism product is priced and sold 
      through distribution channels and it has a life-cycle".
     
     Tourism product covers a wide variety of services including:[27]
     
     Accommodation services from low-cost homestays to five-star hotels
     Hospitality services including food and beverage serving centers
     Health care services like massage
     All modes of transport, its booking and rental
     Travel agencies, guided tours and tourist guides
     Cultural services such as religious monuments, museums, and historical places
     Shopping
     International tourism
     
     International tourist arrivals per year by region
     International tourism is tourism that crosses national borders. Globalisation has made tourism a popular global leisure activity. 
     The World Tourism Organization defines tourists as people "traveling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for
      not more than one consecutive year for leisure, business and other purposes".[28] The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates
       that up to 500,000 people are in flight at any one time.[29]
     
     In 2010, international tourism reached US$919B, growing 6.5% over 2009, corresponding to an increase in real terms of 4.7%.[30] 
     In 2010, there were over 940 million international tourist arrivals worldwide.[31] By 2016 that number had risen to 1,235 million,
      producing 1,220 billion USD in destination spending.[32] The COVID-19 crisis had significant negative effects on international 
      tourism significantly slowing the overall increasing trend.
     
     International tourism has significant impacts on the environment, exacerbated in part by the problems created by air travel but 
     also by other issues, including wealthy tourists bringing lifestyles that stress local infrastructure, water and trash systems
      among others.</h1>
